                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Aside from spending countless hours in school for Computer Science, which is something that I may or may not enjoy at times. 
                    I like to spend my time doing outdoor activities such as hiking or backpacking. One of my favorite national park is the North Cascade
                    where I have spent 5 days backpacking with friends. It is a national park that is known for its beauty, but does not recent a lot of visitors
                    due to how remote it is. My goal for this website is to showcase some of the projects that I have created.
                 </p>
